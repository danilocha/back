In India too, hip-hop culture is becoming increasingly popular. Besides Hindi, there is a phenomenal increase in number of hip-hop artists emerging in local vernacular languages across India. The recent commercial success of Bollywood blockbuster Gully Boy also acted as a catalyst in bringing the culture of India’s underground hip-hop scene to the forefront. Amidst all this organic growth of India hip-hop culture, it is hard to miss the influences from American hip-hop scene. Bridging cultures through Hip-Hop aims to explore the commonalities and differences between India and the United States through this influential music genre.\n\nFrom the beginning, hip-hop musicians in the USA have used their art to highlight socio-political problems, particularly pertaining to youth in underserved and other minority communities. Through this program, the Embassy aims to show the vibrancy and innovative creativity of U.S. society, and talk about using hip-hop music as a form of free expression, and promote values such as freedom of expression, pluralism, tolerance and inclusion, and to increase a sense of connection by building linkages across communities that normally do not interact. \n\nThrough this funding opportunity, the Public Affairs Section, U.S. Embassy New Delhi is requesting proposals for a project entitled Bridging Cultures Through Hip-Hop that would recruit an American hip-hop artist/group to engage with diverse audiences in 4-5 cities in India.\n\nUnder this project, the grantee will organize and implement the travel to India of a hip-hop artist/group from the U.S. for 10-14 days. The recipient will include at least one American musician or production company of American or mixed composition. \n\nIn addition to identifying an American Hip-Hop performer/group, the grantee will also be responsible for coordinating the travel to India, organizing their performances at prominent cultural festivals in India, and arranging for two to three other interactions per program day such as performances, master classes, and workshops that would make the work and the cultural dialogue accessible to young Indians. Special consideration will be given to proposals that would assist in increasing community engagement and building linkages between Indian and U.S. institutions. \n\nThe goal is to engage citizens and artists in social action through music productions that highlight the achievements of the arts in America, promote respect for cultural diversity and understanding, and emphasize the role of music as a form of free expression and tool to promote tolerance and inclusion in democracy. The recipient is encouraged to identify potential institutional partners and target audiences.  \n \nProposals should include a proposed budget for performances and accompanying workshops/master classes in at least 4-5 cities in India. The performances would range in size from small, intimate affairs with a select audience, to large scale public performances. The successful proposal will specify any required materials or equipment for the performances and workshops. \n\nPotential venues for performances and workshops would be proposed by both the recipient and U.S. Mission India cultural programming staff, and the final decision will be the Embassy’s. The U.S. Mission will work with the program partner, local partners, and with other appropriate institutions to identify priority locations for this project. \n\nPerformances and workshops may be recorded and prepared for broadcast/social media

This exposure to discussions, presentations and networking opportunities will help Indian administrators forge collaborations with their American counterparts. PAS India believes that higher education advocacy organizations like Association of International Education Administrators (AIEA) provide opportunities for Indian and American institutions to explore common strategies and forge collaborations. Annual conferences organized by these two and other prominent associations or advocacy groups could be an excellent platform for Indian universities to meet, negotiate, and discuss with their American counterparts in order to develop ideas to collaborate. Collaboration includes setting up joint academic programs like joint Ph.D. degrees, study abroad programs, research collaborations, and potentially hiring young post-doctoral scholars from the United States.  PAS India will work with the grantee to identify a cohort comprising higher education leaders from all consulate regions in India to be part of this group of education leaders that can leverage the AIEA platform. PAS New Delhi will take the lead in working with the selected grantee to identify higher education leaders who have demonstrated interest and have proven record of supporting U.S.-India collaborations. After disseminating information about this opportunity to education contacts, the project will develop and distribute an application to select best-fit candidates.In the application process, we will request the applicant to clearly outline how they will benefit from this opportunity to participate in the AIEA conference and the contacts they will be meeting at the event. We will target a combination of senior education administrators who have in the past attended these conferences and select some education leaders who may have not attended these conferences but have a clear idea of leveraging the opportunity. We will also support candidates who have clear and cogent ideas about how they will complement the AIEA experience by combining it with visits to U.S. research labs and U.S. institutions. Applicants should provide a coherent plan to utilize this opportunity beyond partaking in sessions alone in order to be selected. This opportunity will be to support intense networking and collaboration building for Indian universities.The AIEA conference is scheduled to take place at Washington DC in February 2021.PAS India intends to develop new educational collaborations and research partnerships between selected Indian and U.S. universities to reinforce our people-to-people ties, strengthen on-ground partnerships, and create economic value for American universities. Economic value will be created through academic collaborations that will allow for more Indian students to pursue partial degree requirements in the United States and by U.S. universities offering advisory and consultancy services to Indian educational institutions. The people-to-people ties of this program will be evidenced through the connections forged between scholars of both countries. (Please refer to the full announcement available under related documents tab)"},{"titulo":"Link to Additional Information:","contenido":"U.S. Embassy New Delhi"},{"titulo":"Grantor Contact Information:","contenido":"If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:Grant Applications Manager, \nU.S. Embassy, New DelhiGrant Applications Manager"}]}}],[{"id":"326034","data":{"generalInfo":[{"titulo":"Document Type:","contenido":"Grants Notice"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Number:","contenido":"BRO-20-NEWTON"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Title:","contenido":"Newton Award for Transformative Ideas during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category:","contenido":"Discretionary"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category Explanation:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Funding Instrument Type:","contenido":"Grant"},{"titulo":"Category of Funding Activity:","contenido":"Science and Technology and other Research and Development"},{"titulo":"Category Explanation:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Expected Number of Awards:","contenido":"10"},{"titulo":"CFDA Number(s):","contenido":"12.630 -- Basic, Applied, and Advanced Research in Science and Engineering"},{"titulo":"Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement:","contenido":"No"},{"titulo":"Version:","contenido":"Synopsis 2"},{"titulo":"Posted Date:","contenido":"Apr 03, 2020"},{"titulo":"Last Updated Date:","contenido":"Apr 03, 2020"},{"titulo":"Original Closing Date for Applications:","contenido":"May 15, 2020"},{"titulo":"Current Closing Date for Applications:","contenido":"May 15, 2020"},{"titulo":"Archive Date:","contenido":"Jun 14, 2020"},{"titulo":"Estimated Total Program Funding:","contenido":"$500,000"},{"titulo":"Award Ceiling:","contenido":"$100,000"},{"titulo":"Award Floor:","contenido":"$10,000"}],"elegibility":[{"titulo":"Eligible Applicants:","contenido":"Private institutions of higher educationPublic and State controlled institutions of higher education"},{"titulo":"Additional Information on Eligibility:","contenido":""}],"additionalInformation":[{"titulo":"Agency Name:","contenido":"Department of Defense"},{"titulo":"Description:","contenido":"Background: From 1665 to 1666, the Great Plague of London swept across England, likely taking the lives of over 100,000 people (United Kingdom Public Archives, 2020). Though the germ theory of disease would not be formulated until the 1860s, the English public engaged in “social distancing” behaviors to avoid illness (Washington Post, 2020), leading to the closure of universities. Among the displaced was a young Isaac Newton, still a student at Trinity College in Cambridge. During the ensuing year of isolated study and reflection, Newton developed the basis for calculus, as well as foundational theories in gravitation, motion, and optics.Separated from the Great Plague by 350 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to similar health responses among the general public and scientific community, forcing the closure of laboratories and universities throughout the world and slowing scientific progress across theoretical and empirical domains. To help stimulate scientific thought and encourage efforts and advancements in the spirit of Sir Isaac, the Basic Research Office in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announces the Newton Award for Transformative Ideas during the COVID-19 Pandemic.Program Objective: This award will be presented to a single investigator or team of up to two investigators that develops a “transformative idea” to resolve challenges, advance frontiers, and set new paradigms in areas of immense potential benefit to DoD and the nation at large. Proposals should aim to produce novel conceptual frameworks or theory-based approaches that present disruptive ways of thinking about fundamental scientific problems that have evaded resolution, propose new, paradigm-shifting scientific directions, and/or address fundamental and important questions that are argued to be undervalued by the scientific community. Approaches can include analytical reasoning, calculations, simulations, and thought experiments. While data collection and production are therefore allowed, all supporting data should be generated without the use of laboratory-based experimentation or instrumentation.Given the novelty of and circumstances surrounding this one-time Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the objective of this program is to generate proposals that are equally novel and pioneering. Therefore, this FOA should be viewed as an opportunity to propose work outside the bounds of traditional proposals.Expectations of Award Recipients: Newton Award recipients will produce novel conceptual frameworks or theoretical approaches to addressing outstanding or emerging challenges facing the scientific community. The resulting frameworks and approaches should include clear predictions that can be tested by the scientific community in the years following the return to the laboratory environment. Findings must be submitted as pre-publication material in open archives and disseminated through open publication in a journal. Award winners will brief the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) leadership at the end of the award period of performance, and may be asked to design and chair a Future Directions Workshop on the topic of their findings.
