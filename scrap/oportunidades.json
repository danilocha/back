Foreign investors, however, frequently decide to locate production nodes elsewhere in the region, noting the lack of regional integration and resulting costs of using India as a global export base. Successful economic integration into the broader Indo-Pacific is crucial for developing India’s manufacturing sector, stimulating economic growth, and creating jobs for the one million Indians joining the work force every month. What are the options available to Indian entrepreneurs, businesses, and policy makers to attract such investment? What are the main impediments? Specifically, how have investment conditions changed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and has regional integration changed business calculations in light of travel and shipping restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic? These are among the many questions requiring deeper discussion, debate, and published analysis. \n  \n  \n Through this initiative the successful applicant will bring together Indian and regional thought leaders in New Delhi and across the Indo-Pacific region to discuss, analyze and formulate policy recommendations to improve India’s integration in regional and global supply chains. Rather than merely provide a platform for presentations and academic discussions, these events should be maximally interactive. In this regard, proposals taking a creative approach to intellectual discussion and debate and that integrate modern conference formats are strongly encouraged[1]. Applicants should develop at least 10 audio/visual or other products designed to spark discussion for each topic at these events – for example, extremely brief video recorded interviews with Indian/foreign business leaders offering their views on event topics.

Building on the NSF S&CC program and the extensive S&CC ecosystem, CIVIC aims to accelerate the impact of S&CC research, and deepen cooperation and information sharing across sectors and regions. CIVIC will lay a foundation for a broader and more fluid exchange of research interests and civic priorities that will create new instances of collaboration and introduce new areas of technical and social scientific discovery. CIVIC will fund projects that can produce significant community impact within 12 months (following a four-month planning phase) — in contrast to many community-university partnerships that take years to provide tangible benefits to communities — and have the potential for lasting impact beyond the period of the CIVIC award.\n\n\nCIVIC introduces several unique features that differentiate it from the NSF S&CC program: (1) CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, asking communities to identify civic priorities ripe for innovation and then to partner with researchers to address those priorities; (2) CIVIC focuses on research that is ready for piloting in and with communities on a short timescale, where real-world impact can be evaluatedwithin 12 months; (3) CIVIC requires the inclusion of civic partners in the core project team, to emphasize civic engagement; and (4) CIVIC organizes and fosters “communities of practice” around high-need problem areas that allow for meaningful knowledge sharing and cross-site collaboration during both pre-development and piloting. For purposes of clarity, civic partners may include local, state, or tribal government officials; non-profit representatives; community organizers or advocates; community service providers; and/or others working to improve their communities.\n\n\nCIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition withtwo tracks centered around the following topic areas:\n\n\nTrack A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs; and\nTrack B. Resilience to Natural Disasters: Equipping Communities for Greater Preparedness and Resilience to Natural Disasters.\n\n\nIn the first stage (Stage 1), up to 12 awards per track will be made for Planning Grants – each with a budget of up to $50,000 for four months to undertake pre-development activities, includingsolidifying the team, maturing the project plans, and preparing to submit a well-developed full proposal for Stage 2. Only awardees of Stage 1 will be eligible to submit proposals for Stage 2. \n\n\nIn the second stage (Stage 2), up tofour teams per track will be selected from Stage 1 award recipients to receive a full award — each with a budget of up to $1,000,000 for up to 12 months to execute and evaluate their research-centered pilot projects.\n\n\nThroughout both stages, NSF grantee (NSF award 1931690) MetroLab Network (metrolabnetwork.org) will foster “communities of practice” through in-person and web-based activities, aimed at enhancing the teams’ capacity-building, networking, impact, and ability to create methods and solutions transferable to other communities.\n\n\nThis research and action competition is jointly supported by NSF’s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Track A is supported by NSF and DOE. Track B is supported by NSF/CISE and DHS.

Commitment to evidence-based programming, continuous learning, accountability, a deep understanding of context, and focus on results are the central principles that will drive evidence and data priorities. To be realized, development actors need timely, relevant, and robust data and evidence. Such data and evidence are frequently unavailable, inaccessible, of poor quality, or in need of translation for policy and practice. Additional research is therefore needed to fill these gaps. When such data and evidence are available, their use is frequently undermined by the inability of decision-makers to access them and to use them appropriately.In broad consultations with internal and external stakeholders, as well as reviews of the literature and available evidence, the USAID Office of Education has identified critical gaps in the evidence base across the spectrum of education related technical areas and produced four associated Learning Agendas to help inform research and learning in the education sector. The Learning Agendas were developed through deliberative, collaborative perspective with internal and external stakeholders in the global education sector, including other donors. These Learning Agendas also incorporate cross-cutting themes such as gender, equity, disability inclusion, education finance, cost, and information and communications technology.      \nAdvancing USAID learning priorities in the global education sector as a global good to improve education and learning outcomes is the overarching goal of this Addendum to the HELIX APS. \nThe Supporting Holistic and Actionable Research in Education (SHARE) Addendum is not a Request for Application (RFA) but rather a request for Concept Note(s) in response to this Addendum published under the HELIX APS.

These centers and institutes, affiliated with each other through the Academy Research Council (ARC), coordinated and supported by the Academic Research Division (ARD), provide the infrastructure necessary to tackle the nation’s and the world’s most challenging problems. Our research centers and institutes bring context to the classroom, are central to our vibrant and pioneering faculty, and are one way West Point connects to the Army and to the Nation. Our students are driven, our faculty is world-class, and through our centers, scholars and scientists thrive and produce their best work. Cadets regularly win Best Paper Awards at national and international graduate-level conferences, our faculty hold fellowships and chairmanships in their discipline's national organizations and our products are deployed to the soldier. In addition to applied research, there are centers and institutes at West Point that focus on other aspects of the USMA mission.  The USMA BAA identifies topics of interest to the USMA departments, directorates, and research centers and institutes.  These groups focus on executing in-house research programs, with a significant emphasis on collaborative research with other organizations. The groups fund a modest amount of extramural research in certain specific areas, and those areas are described in this BAA.

Though the germ theory of disease would not be formulated until the 1860s, the English public engaged in “social distancing” behaviors to avoid illness (Washington Post, 2020), leading to the closure of universities. Among the displaced was a young Isaac Newton, still a student at Trinity College in Cambridge. During the ensuing year of isolated study and reflection, Newton developed the basis for calculus, as well as foundational theories in gravitation, motion, and optics.Separated from the Great Plague by 350 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to similar health responses among the general public and scientific community, forcing the closure of laboratories and universities throughout the world and slowing scientific progress across theoretical and empirical domains. To help stimulate scientific thought and encourage efforts and advancements in the spirit of Sir Isaac, the Basic Research Office in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announces the Newton Award for Transformative Ideas during the COVID-19 Pandemic.Program Objective: This award will be presented to a single investigator or team of up to two investigators that develops a “transformative idea” to resolve challenges, advance frontiers, and set new paradigms in areas of immense potential benefit to DoD and the nation at large. Proposals should aim to produce novel conceptual frameworks or theory-based approaches that present disruptive ways of thinking about fundamental scientific problems that have evaded resolution, propose new, paradigm-shifting scientific directions, and/or address fundamental and important questions that are argued to be undervalued by the scientific community. Approaches can include analytical reasoning, calculations, simulations, and thought experiments. While data collection and production are therefore allowed, all supporting data should be generated without the use of laboratory-based experimentation or instrumentation.Given the novelty of and circumstances surrounding this one-time Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), the objective of this program is to generate proposals that are equally novel and pioneering. Therefore, this FOA should be viewed as an opportunity to propose work outside the bounds of traditional proposals.Expectations of Award Recipients: Newton Award recipients will produce novel conceptual frameworks or theoretical approaches to addressing outstanding or emerging challenges facing the scientific community. The resulting frameworks and approaches should include clear predictions that can be tested by the scientific community in the years following the return to the laboratory environment. Findings must be submitted as pre-publication material in open archives and disseminated through open publication in a journal. Award winners will brief the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)) leadership at the end of the award period of performance, and may be asked to design and chair a Future Directions Workshop on the topic of their findings. In addition, OUSD(R&E) will support winners with successful projects in finding pathways to continue the funding of their transformative ideas."},{"titulo":"Link to Additional Information:","contenido":"See Related Documents"},{"titulo":"Grantor Contact Information:","contenido":"If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:Jonathan Becker\nGrants Officerjonathan.l.becker2.civ@mail.mil"}]}}],[{"id":"326013","data":{"generalInfo":[{"titulo":"Document Type:","contenido":"Grants Notice"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Number:","contenido":"RFI-121-20-000001"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Title:","contenido":"Furthering Health System Reforms in Ukraine"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category:","contenido":"Other"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category Explanation:","contenido":"This Request for Information (RFI) relates to an activity with the preliminary title of “Furthering Health System Reforms in Ukraine.”"},{"titulo":"Funding Instrument Type:","contenido":"Other"},{"titulo":"Category of Funding Activity:","contenido":"Health"},{"titulo":"Category Explanation:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Expected Number of Awards:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"CFDA Number(s):","contenido":"98.001 -- USAID Foreign Assistance for Programs Overseas"},{"titulo":"Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement:","contenido":"No"},{"titulo":"Version:","contenido":"Synopsis 1"},{"titulo":"Posted Date:","contenido":"Apr 02, 2020"},{"titulo":"Last Updated Date:","contenido":"Apr 02, 2020"},{"titulo":"Original Closing Date for Applications:","contenido":"Apr 30, 2020  Request for Information No. RFI-121-20-000001 closing date is Thursday, April 30, 2020, 12:00 pm Kyiv Time"},{"titulo":"Current Closing Date for Applications:","contenido":"Apr 30, 2020  Request for Information No. RFI-121-20-000001 closing date is Thursday, April 30, 2020, 12:00 pm Kyiv Time"},{"titulo":"Archive Date:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Estimated Total Program Funding:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Award Ceiling:","contenido":"$0"},{"titulo":"Award Floor:","contenido":"$0"}],"elegibility":[{"titulo":"Eligible Applicants:","contenido":"Unrestricted (i.e., open to any type of entity above), subject to any clarification in text field entitled \"Additional Information on Eligibility\""},{"titulo":"Additional Information on Eligibility:","contenido":""}],"additionalInformation":[{"titulo":"Agency Name:","contenido":"Ukraine USAID-Kiev"},{"titulo":"Description:","contenido":"This Request for Information (RFI) relates to an activity with the preliminary title of “Furthering Health System Reforms in Ukraine.”  \nThe purpose of this RFI is to:  \n1.                  Obtain details concerning interest in USAID’s anticipated requirements; and  \n2.                  Obtain public comments on the Questions to inform the design process.  \nThis Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for planning and information seeking purposes. This RFI is open for comments from any interested US and Non-US Organizations.
