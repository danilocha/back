See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. \n \nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2020 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2020. In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2020 solicitation, and the \"Summary of Solicitation\" as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020. \n  \nThis synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under \"Announcement Documents\" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH20ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the overview.  \n  \nFrequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2020 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. \n  \nNot all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.comand checking the appropriate boxes under \"Account Management\" and \"Email Subscriptions\"), (2) The ROSES-2020 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2020, and (3) The ROSES-2020 due date Google calendar.

The interactive website (http://www.researchconnections.org) will house a comprehensive and up-to-date database of resources derived from rigorous research including scholarly peer-reviewed research and ‘gray’ literature (i.e., rigorous research published as policy briefs, state and federal government reports, foundation reports, etc.) and publicly available assessment instruments relevant to child care and early education policy and practice (i.e., community based child care serving children birth through 13-years, Early Care and Education (ECE) programs, home-based child care, family child care, Head Start, public Pre-kindergarten (Pre-K), and after-school programs).\nThe grantee will engage in vigorous marketing of the research database; outreach to gather feedback and improve the database, the site and other products; and development of high quality products to improve utilization of the site and of the evidence base. Research Connections will collaborate to gather feedback, identify the latest research and resources available; and note research needs of the state, territory and tribal administrators of the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program and child care and early education researchers.  Research Connections may pursue this information through collaboration with child care and education research organizations and agencies that promote the use of the research base to improve the quality and promote equal access to those programs; strengthen the supply of care and education to support parental employment, training and education; and inform the development and implementation of system-level approaches to coordination of program services for children and families (e.g., Child Care and Early Education Policy Research Consortium (CCEEPRC); Child Care Research and Evaluation Capacity Building Center (CCRECBC); other U.S. Department of Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Child Care and Head Start Technical Assistance Centers).

Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS especially for real-time operation creates new research opportunities with major societal implications.\n\n\nWhile tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today's systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded.\n\n\nThe CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program includecontrol, data analytics, and machinelearning—including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPSand accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world.\n\n\nAll proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description:\n\n\nAResearch Descriptionthat describes the technical rationaleand technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components.This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include:\n\nA subsection titled \"CPS Research Focus\" which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made;\n\n\nAn Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success;\nA Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration; and\nA Broader Impacts sectionthat describes how the research will be disseminated to a broad and diverse audience. This should go beyond traditional academic publications and includes education and outreach from the research team spanning multiple levels of engagement. Broader Impacts encompasses Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) and Engineering (BPE).\n\n\nIn FY 2020, NSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); several National Institutes of Health (NIH) institutes and centers including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA).\n\n\nProposals for three classes of research and education projects—differing in scope and goals—are supported through the CPS program:\n\n\n\n\nSmallprojects mayrequest a total budget of up to $500,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. Note that Small projects are not accepted under this solicitation.\n\n\n\n\nMedium projects may request a total budget ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines.\n\n\nFrontierprojects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today's systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that the Frontier project deadline is different than that for Medium projects.\n\n\nPlease note, this solicitation includes windows for Medium and Frontier proposals. Small proposals are not invited in FY 2020. For FY 2021 (beginning Oct. 1, 2020) and beyond, the CPS program anticipates going to a \"no-deadline\" submission for Small and Medium proposals. Specific annual deadlines for Frontier proposals are anticipated to continue as noted in this solicitation."},{"titulo":"Link to Additional Information:","contenido":"NSF Publication 20-563"},{"titulo":"Grantor Contact Information:","contenido":"If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:NSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.govIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above."}]}}],[{"id":"326119","data":{"docs":[{"fileDescription":"Folder: Full Announcement -

Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS especially for real-time operation creates new research opportunities with major societal implications.\n\n\nWhile tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today's systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded.\n\n\nThe CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program includecontrol, data analytics, and machinelearning—including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPSand accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world.\n\n\nAll proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description:\n\n\nAResearch Descriptionthat describes the technical rationaleand technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components.This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include:\n\nA subsection titled \"CPS Research Focus\" which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made;\n\n\nAn Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success;\nA Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration; and\nA Broader Impacts sectionthat describes how the research will be disseminated to a broad and diverse audience. This should go beyond traditional academic publications and includes education and outreach from the research team spanning multiple levels of engagement. Broader Impacts encompasses Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) and Engineering (BPE).\n\n\nIn FY 2020, NSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); several National Institutes of Health (NIH) institutes and centers including the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA).\n\n\nProposals for three classes of research and education projects—differing in scope and goals—are supported through the CPS program:\n\n\n\n\nSmallprojects mayrequest a total budget of up to $500,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. Note that Small projects are not accepted under this solicitation.\n\n\n\n\nMedium projects may request a total budget ranging from $500,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines.\n\n\nFrontierprojects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today's systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that the Frontier project deadline is different than that for Medium projects.\n\n\nPlease note, this solicitation includes windows for Medium and Frontier proposals. Small proposals are not invited in FY 2020. For FY 2021 (beginning Oct. 1, 2020) and beyond, the CPS program anticipates going to a \"no-deadline\" submission for Small and Medium proposals. Specific annual deadlines for Frontier proposals are anticipated to continue as noted in this solicitation."},{"titulo":"Link to Additional Information:","contenido":"NSF Publication 20-563"},{"titulo":"Grantor Contact Information:","contenido":"If you have difficulty accessing the full announcement electronically, please contact:NSF grants.gov support\ngrantsgovsupport@nsf.govIf you have any problems linking to this funding announcement, please contact the email address above."}]}}],[{"id":"326092","data":{"docs":[{"fileDescription":"Folder: Revised Full Announcement - P20AS00057 Notice of Intent","nombre":"P20AS00057-Revised Full Announcement - P20AS00057 Notice of Intent.zip","idDoc":"javascript:downloadFolderZip(45798);","ultimaActualizacion":"Apr 07, 2020 12:57:09 PM EDT","fileSize":"322.5 KB"},{"fileDescription":"P20AS00057 Notice of Intent to Award","nombre":"P20AS00057 NOII.pdf","idDoc":"javascript:downloadAttachment(296715);","ultimaActualizacion":"Apr 07, 2020 12:57:09 PM EDT","fileSize":"329.2 KB"}],"generalInfo":[{"titulo":"Document Type:","contenido":"Grants Notice"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Number:","contenido":"P20AS00057"},{"titulo":"Funding Opportunity Title:","contenido":"Baseline Archaeological Inventory in Western Arctic National Parks"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category:","contenido":"Discretionary"},{"titulo":"Opportunity Category Explanation:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Funding Instrument Type:","contenido":"Cooperative Agreement"},{"titulo":"Category of Funding Activity:","contenido":"Humanities (see \"Cultural Affairs\" in CFDA)Information and Statistics"},{"titulo":"Category Explanation:","contenido":""},{"titulo":"Expected Number of Awards:","contenido":"1"},{"titulo":"CFDA Number(s):","contenido":"15.945 -- Cooperative Research and Training Programs � Resources of the National Park System"},{"titulo":"Cost Sharing or Matching Requirement:","contenido":"No"},{"titulo":"Version:","contenido":"Synopsis 1"},{"titulo":"Posted Date:","contenido":"Apr 07, 2020"},{"titulo":"Last Updated Date:","contenido":"Apr 07, 2020"},{"titulo":"Original Closing Date for Applications:","contenido":"Apr 13, 2020  This is a notice of intent to award to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Museum of the North.

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. \n \nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) – 2020 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2020. In this case \"omnibus\" means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates, the full text of the ROSES-2020 solicitation, and the \"Summary of Solicitation\" as a stand-alone document, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020. \n  \nThis synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2020table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under \"Announcement Documents\" the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH20ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on “C.8 Lunar Data Analysis (.PDF)” to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read “C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.PDF)” from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the overview.  \n  \nFrequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2020 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. \n  \nNot all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.comand checking the appropriate boxes under \"Account Management\" and \"Email Subscriptions\"), (2) The ROSES-2020 RSS feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/ROSES-2020, and (3) The ROSES-2020 due date Google calendar.
